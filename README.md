# About Me

I'm a 4th-year **Computer Engineering** student with a keen interest in **backend development**â€”currently learning **Django**â€”and a passion for **computer networking**. While I don't have major projects to brag about (yet!), I'm always working on improving my skills, especially by customizing (ricing) my **Neovim** and **PowerShell** terminal.

I also run a **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JoeCillo-zr8jn)** where I share my tech journey and experiments.
